# BookStore-OOP-implementation-
This is a repo for a small project implementing the OOP Fundamentals I've learned so far
# What this small project about
it's about using the OOP fundamentals such as 
- Encapsulation
- Data hiding
- Aggregation relations
- Compostition relations
- UML Designing 

# How to follow up with the code
just read the header, it contains all the classes declarations and it has lots of comment lines describing the functions and how they work.
it's divided into these main classes:
- User (admin | reader)
- Book
- History
- Using Mode (Interface)
- program (flow controler)

# Try it yourself
just download the .exe file and signup.

there's a dummy admin mode with the the credintials :
username:reader1
password:9999
